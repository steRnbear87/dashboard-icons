      value: "Thank you for your interest in contributing to our icon repository! To ensure smooth collaboration, we've established clear guidelines for contributors.\n## 🌟 Icon Specifications\n\n- Icons should be provided in both `PNG` and `SVG` formats. Formats like `JPEG` or `WEBP` will not be accepted.\n  - If an `SVG` version is unavailable, a `PNG` version alone suffices.\n  - Conversely, if a `PNG` version is missing, it can be generated using [Ezgif SVG to PNG](https://github.com/walkxcode/dashboard-icons/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-converting-svg-to-png).\n\n- `PNG` files should have a height of exactly `512px` Width can vary, but a 1:1 aspect ratio is preferred.\n  - ❗ Exceptions for upscales will be made only if the correct or a downscaled version cannot be obtained.\n  - Downsizing can be accomplished using [iLoveIMG Resize](https://github.com/walkxcode/dashboard-icons/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-downscaling-pngs).\n\n- Icons should be named using the [Kebab Case](https://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase) convention, reflecting their full name. For instance, \"Facebook Messenger\" should be named `facebook-messenger.png`.\n\n- Monochrome icons should default to a dark version. Light versions should be named `name-light.png`. If a light version is absent, utilize [https://pinetools.com/colorize-image](https://pinetools.com/colorize-image) to adjust its color.\n"
