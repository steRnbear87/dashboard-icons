# ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

We appreciate your interest in contributing to our icon repository! To ensure smooth collaboration, kindly adhere to the following guidelines:

## üåü Icon Specifications

- Icons should be provided in both `PNG` and `SVG` formats. Other formats like `JPEG` or `WEBP` will not be accepted.
  - In cases where an `SVG` version is unavailable, a `PNG` version alone suffices.
  - Conversely, if a `PNG` version is missing, it can be generated using [Ezgif SVG to PNG](#-converting-svg-to-png).
- `PNG`s should maintain a height of exactly `512px`, while width can vary. However, a 1:1 aspect ratio is preferred.
  - ‚ùó Avoid upscales! Exceptions will be made only if the correct or a downscaled version cannot be obtained.
  - Downsizing can be accomplished using [iLoveIMG Resize](#-downscaling-pngs).
- Icons should be named using the [Kebab Case](https://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase) convention, reflecting their full name. For instance, "Facebook Messenger" should be named `facebook-messenger.png`.
- Icons that are predominantly monochrome should default to a dark version. Light versions should be named `name-light.png`. If a light version is not available, use [https://pinetools.com/colorize-image](https://pinetools.com/colorize-image) to adjust its color.

## üíª Gitmoji Commits

- Use [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) in your commit messages. This helps us keep our commit history clear and easy to understand. For instance, use the `üç±` emoji for commits related to updating icon colors, and `üìù` for documentation updates.
